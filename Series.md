# API-led Application Integration
### Work-in-progress

In this series, will use Integration Designer to create an API which takes a car repair claim request, complete with a photograph of the car, and integrates with a SaaS CRM system and IBMâ€™s Watson AI to create a car repair case with all the correct details loaded into the SaaS system. and data routed to the correct location based on the image contents; all in a few seconds before returning a response to the customer. We will then add API management capabilities to our Integration application, apply security and rate-plans and publish it to Self-Service Portal. We'll show how applications are registered to API server.

The series will consist of two parts as follows:
Part1: Is a Code Pattern and demonstrates building and hosting of Integration Application. More details [here](https://github.ibm.com/IBMCode/IBMCodeContent/issues/4407)
Part2: Will be a tutorial and demonstrates API Management capabilities of ICP4i to Manage the API, apply security and rate-plans and publish it to a Self-Service Portal. More details [here](https://github.ibm.com/IBMCode/IBMCodeContent/issues/4504)
